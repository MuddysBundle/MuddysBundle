## Hosting Locally

### Prerequisites

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

### Setup

In the command line:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/MuddysBundle/MuddysBundle
cd src
npm install
```

> Note the following step is only necessary if you are wanting to download packs. If you are just trying to develop the frontend, you don't need to set up dropbox.

Create a new app at https://www.dropbox.com/developers/apps and give it the permissions `files.content.write`, `files.content.read` and `sharing.write`. Generate an access token.  
Create a new file `.env.example` (in `/src/` based off of `.env.example`). The `DBXACCESSTOKEN` should be the access token you just generated on dropbox.com.

### Running

To run and host the project, run the following your command line from the `src` folder:
```sh
npm start
```
